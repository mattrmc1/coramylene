I work by appointment only."},{question:"Do you have an hourly minimum? If so, why?",answer:"Yes, my hourly minimum is 3 hours. I have an hourly minimum because I like to focus my time on medium to large sized tattoos."},{question:"What is your hourly rate?",answer:"My hourly rate is $125/h currently but will go up to $150/h starting January 1st, 2018."},{question:"What kind of tattoos do you like to do?",answer:"I love to tattoo things like animals, flowers, plants, lady heads, insects, and other organic things. I would really like to do more neo-traditional tattoos."},{question:"What kind of tattoos do you not want to do?",answer:"Realistic portraits and words/lettering. Those are not things that I tattoo and it is very important to find the right tattooer who specializes in the style you are looking for. "},{question:"Do yo do cover-ups?",answer:"I do, but selectively. I will only do a cover-up that I know I can successfully do. Cover-ups are very tricky and are all different cases. This is something I would need to talk to you about in person to see what the tattoo you'd like to get covered looks like, what you'd want it covered up by, how big you're wanting the cover-up to be, etc."},{question:"Are you the right artist for me?",answer:"If you like what I've done in the past and if you'd like something that falls in the same style as my work, I'd like to think so! If we end up not being a good fit, I am happy to give recommendations and referrals to another artist in town."},{question:"When can I get tattooed by you?",answer:"Please see my Booking Schedule page."},{question:"How do I book an appointment?",answer:"Please see my Inquiries page."},{question:"What days do you work at the shop?",answer:"I am typically at the shop Wednesday - Saturday."},{question:"Do you require a consultation before setting up an appointment?",answer:"Only if I feel your tattoo concept/design needs more in-person clarification."},{question:"Do you take a deposit for the tattoo appointment?",answer:"Yes, I take a $100 deposit. This is to ensure that you are committed and will show up on the time and date of the appointment(s) we set up for you. The deposit will come out of the final price of the tattoo. If the tattoo requires multiple sessions, the deposit will be taken out during the last session. The deposit is non-refundable and non-transferable.  "},{question:"How do I pay for a tattoo that requires multiple sessions?",answer:"You always pay by the session, so however long each sessions last is how much it will be on that day."},{question:"How long are the sessions?",answer:"It depends on what we are working on. I normally work on a tattoo for about 3-4 hours at a time. You are also welcome to book a full day (6-8 hours) session with me if you prefer getting more done in one sitting."},{question:"When can I see the design of my future tattoo?",answer:"I will have your design ready to be looked at and reviewed when you come in on your appointment. We can discuss the details and potential changes at that time."},{question:"How can I get ready for my session?",answer:"I recommend coming in after a good meal and with snacks. It's a good idea to bring your own pillow as well for extra comfort. We provide water at the shop. If you are getting tattooed on your hip/leg, bringing a loose-fitting pair of pants or a flowy skirt/dress would be best."},{question:"Can I bring people with me when I come get tattooed?",answer:"You're welcome to bring someone during your session, however please limit to one person as we have limited chairs and seating. "},{question:"Do you take cards, checks or cash?",answer:"I take cash and cards, but no checks. Please note that for credit or debit cards, you will be charged a 3% convenience fee by PayPal."}]},57:function(e,t,o){"use strict";function n(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var a=o(0),s=n(a),i=o(13),r=o(278),l=n(r);t.default=(0,i.withSiteData)(function(){return s.default.createElement(l.default,null)})}});
